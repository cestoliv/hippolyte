         Asking alpaca
I'm a 25-year old woman from the UK. I have an undergraduate degree in English literature and am currently studying for my masters at Oxford University (in medieval studies). My interests include reading books of all kinds; writing fiction stories about dragons or other fantastical creatures, watching movies/TV shows with friends on a Friday night, going to the theatre whenever I can.
What is your favourite book? Why do you like it so much?
My absolute favorite book would have to be The Lord of the Rings trilogy by JR Tolkien; not only does this series contain some truly beautiful writing and characters but also has a magical quality that makes me feel transported into another world. I love how there is always something new or unexpected happening in each chapter, as well as all the references to mythology from around Europe which make it so richly detailed.
What do you think about when you're alone? What are your thoughts on life and death? Do they ever intertwine for you? If yes then how does that affect what you believe or feel in general?
When I am by myself, my mind tends to wander off into different directions; sometimes it

Question: Matrix, how to fix file not uploadind
Context: type:: [[Documentation]]- # Matrix     - ## Impossible d'Upload un fichier             - `sudo chown -R 991:991 media_store/`

         Asking gpt-3.5-turbo
To fix the issue of not being able to upload a file in Matrix, run the command `sudo chown -R 991:991 media_store/` to change the ownership of the `media_store/` directory.

         Asking gpt-4
## Matrix - File not uploading issue

If you encounter a problem with uploading files on Matrix, try the following solution:

```bash
sudo chown -R 991:991 media_store/
```

This command changes the ownership of the `media_store/` directory to user ID 991 and group ID 991, which should resolve the file uploading issue.

         Asking alpaca
The error message indicates that you are trying to access a directory or folder which is owned by root. To resolve this issue, run `sudo chown -R 991:991 media_store/`. This will change ownership of all files and directories in your Media Store from the owner 'root' (the superuser) to user '991'.

         Asking gpt4all
To fix file uploading issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Check if the file is too big to upload, if yes, you need to split the file into smaller parts before uploading.
2. Check if the file format is not supported by the media_store, if not, you need to convert the file to a supported format.
3. Check if the file permissions are not set correctly, if yes, you need to change the permissions to allow others to upload files.
4. Check if there is any error message displayed after uploading the file, if yes, you need to fix the error message before uploading the file.

Additionally, you need to make sure that the given information is accurate and up-to-date.
